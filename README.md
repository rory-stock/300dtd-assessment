## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Need a simple way to share and display my portfolio and photos from events. At the moment my event photos can only be viewed through google drive which is quite slow and not the most user friendly. 

### End-User Requirements

Owner of site: Needs to be able to easily add/update images in portfolio and somewhat automate adding event images.

Viewers of site: Members of the public. Need to be able to easily access and download images. Site needs to be fast and responsive so that it is more useful than google drive.

Possible Clients: Need to be able to easily see examples of my work and an easy way to contact me. 

### Proposed Solution

A website that allows users to easily access view and download my photos

Admin/Owner will be able ot easily add images to the website and add new events/projects from within the website

Users should be able to search for any images that have their raceplate in(raceplate in metadata)
